# Lab Ratz

### Description
RATZ is an online data management system designed to improve the transparency and efficiency of research projects led by university professors and graduate students. Through RATZ, an applicant can generate an application, track its progress, receive authorization documentation, and submit reports. RATS increases the speed with which critical information is relayed between the applicant and the official channels responsible for obtaining and/or issuing authorizations.
